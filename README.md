# Youtube-Crawler
This is a Youtube Crawler written in Python!

My Motivation was to get rid of these plenty ads and redirections if I try to download some Videos or Music!

So I've written a downloader and also converted it to .exe, so you don't have to install Python onto your PC!

When you open the .exe you will be presented with a cmd. Further instructions will be displayed, just follow the steps to download your Video successfully

Disclaimer:
This Downloader is only used to download free Music and Videos! Stuff that was downloaded and used without asking is your own fault. You were warned

So have fun :D
